Using paging can greatly reduce the workload on your server, but it does increase the requests made to the databse.

## The Query

The following query shows in SQL Server Profiler when the paging is in place

```sql
exec sp_executesql N'SELECT [v].[CategoryName], [v].[Contributors], [v].[Genres], [v].[ItemId], [v].[ItemName], [v].[TotalValue]
FROM [vwItemsWithGenresAndContributors] AS [v]
WHERE [v].[ItemName] LIKE @filter OR [v].[Contributors] LIKE @filter
ORDER BY [v].[ItemName]
OFFSET @p ROWS FETCH NEXT @p ROWS ONLY',N'@filter nvarchar(4000),@p int',@filter=N'%a%',@p=10
```
