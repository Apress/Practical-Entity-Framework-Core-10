# Listings

Code listings will often be found in the starter and solution files as markdown files.

## Details

The Listings will map to the listings in the text to help ensure copy/paste is an easy operation and also to allow for brevity in the text with completeness in the code samples.

Finally, using these listings will allow for GitHub repository updates to easily manage the specific code listings in case of error or inefficiencies.
