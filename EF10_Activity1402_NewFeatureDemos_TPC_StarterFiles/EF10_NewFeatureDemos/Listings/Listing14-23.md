# Listing 14-21: The T-SQL generated by the old way cannot leverage the Query Plan on the server

This is the T-SQL generated with the query that uses left join.

## The code

Notice how there are no parameters in this query, which means it will translate to a new query on every execution, requiring the server side to create a new query plan for each execution.  

```sql
SELECT [c].[ContributorName], COUNT(CASE
    WHEN [i0].[Id] IS NOT NULL THEN 1
END) AS [ItemCount]
FROM [Contributors] AS [c]
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT [i].[Id], [i].[ContributorId]
    FROM [ItemContributors] AS [i]
    WHERE [i].[IsDeleted] = CAST(0 AS bit) AND [i].[IsActive] = CAST(1 AS bit)
) AS [i0] ON [c].[Id] = [i0].[ContributorId]
WHERE [c].[IsDeleted] = CAST(0 AS bit) AND [c].[IsActive] = CAST(1 AS bit)
GROUP BY [c].[Id], [c].[ContributorName], [c].[IsActive], [c].[IsDeleted]
```
